# Friends Browser Extension

This extension is heavily based on the Firefox extension [RSS Preview](https://github.com/aureliendavid/rsspreview) by [Aurelien David](https://github.com/aureliendavid).

The extension works in Firefox and Chrome. It allows quick insight into:
- The feeds offered by the current page as `<link rel="alternative" />`.
- Other profiles of the user shown as `<link rel="me" />`.

If you use the [Friends Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/friends/) for WordPress, you can also add the current site as a friend.
